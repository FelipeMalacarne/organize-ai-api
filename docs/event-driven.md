# Step-by-Step Plan to Implement an Event-Driven Architecture

### 1. Choose a Messaging/Event System

Since you’re using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, the best service for implementing an event-driven infrastructure is **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**. It provides scalable, asynchronous messaging between services, enabling components to publish and subscribe to events.

- **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**: A managed messaging system that decouples senders and receivers. It supports many-to-many, asynchronous messaging.

### 2. Event Types and Flow

Define the key events in your application:

- **Document Uploaded Event**: Triggered when a user uploads a document (image or PDF).
- **OCR Completed Event**: Triggered when the OCR service completes text extraction from the document.
- **Layout Detection Completed Event**: Triggered after the layout of the document is detected.
- **Document Classification Completed Event**: Triggered when the document is classified into a category (e.g., invoice, resume, contract).
- **Error Events**: Triggered if something goes wrong in any of the services.

### 3. Component Breakdown

#### **Frontend (Flutter Mobile App)**

- The mobile app still serves as the interface for users to upload documents.
- When a document is uploaded, it sends a request to the **Laravel API**, which emits an event (e.g., `DocumentUploadedEvent`) to **Pub/Sub** for backend processing.

#### **Backend (Laravel API)**

1. **Document Upload Event**:
   - The Laravel API receives the document from the mobile app and uploads it to **Google Cloud Storage**.
   - Once the document is successfully uploaded, the API publishes a `DocumentUploadedEvent` to **Google Cloud Pub/Sub** with metadata like the document’s URL in Cloud Storage, the user ID, and other relevant details.

2. **Event Handling**:
   - **Laravel Event System**: Integrate Pub/Sub with Laravel’s event system. When a document is uploaded, trigger an event that publishes a message to a Pub/Sub topic (e.g., `document-upload`).
   - Use **Google Cloud Pub/Sub PHP Client** to publish events.

#### **Python Microservice (OCR and Layout Detection)**

1. **OCR Service**:
   - A Python microservice is subscribed to the `DocumentUploadedEvent` in Pub/Sub.
   - When the event is received, the microservice fetches the document from Cloud Storage, performs OCR (using Tesseract or Google Vision API), and stores the extracted text back to a database (or another storage service).
   - After OCR is complete, the microservice publishes an `OCRCompletedEvent` to Pub/Sub, signaling that the document is ready for further processing (layout detection or classification).

2. **Layout Detection Service**:
   - Another microservice (or the same OCR service) listens for the `OCRCompletedEvent` to begin layout detection.
   - The layout detection service identifies tables, forms, or structured data within the document and processes it.
   - When layout detection is complete, a `LayoutDetectionCompletedEvent` is published to Pub/Sub.

#### **Machine Learning Service (Document Classification)**

1. **Document Classification**:
   - This service is triggered by the `LayoutDetectionCompletedEvent` or `OCRCompletedEvent` (depending on the workflow).
   - It applies a machine learning model to classify the document into categories (e.g., invoices, resumes, contracts).
   - After classification, it sends a `DocumentClassificationCompletedEvent`, which can update the user’s document in the database or notify them of the completed classification.

#### **Notifications and Updates**

- Whenever a key event happens (e.g., `OCRCompletedEvent` or `DocumentClassificationCompletedEvent`), the backend can update the user in real time through WebSockets or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) notifications.
- The app receives updates when the document processing is completed and the document is ready for review.

### 4. Workflow Example

Here’s how an example workflow could look using the event-driven architecture:

1. **Step 1**: User uploads a document via the Flutter app.
   - The Flutter app sends the document to the **Laravel API**.
   - The Laravel API uploads the document to **GCP Cloud Storage** and publishes a `DocumentUploadedEvent` to Pub/Sub.

2. **Step 2**: The Python OCR microservice receives the `DocumentUploadedEvent`.
   - It processes the document, extracts text using OCR, and uploads the extracted text to a database.
   - Once OCR is complete, the microservice publishes an `OCRCompletedEvent` to Pub/Sub.

3. **Step 3**: The layout detection microservice listens for the `OCRCompletedEvent`.
   - It processes the layout of the document and identifies key sections (like tables, forms, etc.).
   - It then publishes a `LayoutDetectionCompletedEvent` to Pub/Sub.

4. **Step 4**: The machine learning service listens for the `LayoutDetectionCompletedEvent`.
   - It classifies the document (e.g., invoice, contract, resume) based on the content and layout.
   - After classification, it publishes a `DocumentClassificationCompletedEvent`.

5. **Step 5**: The **Laravel API** listens for the `DocumentClassificationCompletedEvent`.
   - Once classification is complete, it updates the document’s metadata in the database.
   - The Laravel API can trigger a notification or send a real-time WebSocket update to the user, letting them know their document is processed and categorized.jk
