# Build the MVP

With the basic setup done, you can start building out the core features of your MVP.

## Backend Development:

1. **Document Upload Endpoint**:
   - Create an API route for users to upload documents (PDFs, images).
   - Store uploaded documents in **GCP Cloud Storage** or locally for now.

2. **OCR Service (Python Microservice)**:
   - Create a small Python service (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) that handles OCR via Tesseract or Google Vision API.
   - Deploy this service on **GCP Cloud Run**.
   - When a document is uploaded, your **Laravel API** will trigger the OCR microservice to extract text from the document.

3. **Document Management**:
   - Create routes for retrieving documents, tagging them, and searching for them using metadata and OCR-extracted text.
   - Store document metadata (title, tags, upload date, extracted text) in the database.

## Flutter Mobile App:

1. **Document Upload**:
   - Implement the UI for users to take a photo or select a document from their phone.
   - Send the document to the **Laravel API** for processing.

2. **Display OCR Results**:
   - Once the OCR is complete, display the extracted text in the app, allowing users to edit or add tags.

3. **Basic Document Management**:
   - Create a simple interface for users to view uploaded documents, search through them, and add tags or categories.

## Iterate and Expand Features

After building the core MVP, you can start expanding functionality based on feedback and adding more advanced features.

### Advanced OCR and Layout Detection:

1. **Layout Detection**:
   - Improve OCR by adding layout detection, such as detecting tables, headers, and form fields. You can either extend the Python microservice with libraries that handle this or use **Googleâ€™s Document AI** for this feature.

2. **Machine Learning for Classification**:
   - Add machine learning to classify documents automatically based on their content. You could start by training a simple model with pre-defined categories (e.g., invoice, contract, resume) and expand over time.

---

## Developer API:

1. **Public API for Developers**:
   - Once you have a stable document processing pipeline, you can expose your API for third-party developers. Make sure to implement rate-limiting, authentication (OAuth or API tokens), and usage tracking.

2. **API Documentation**:
   - Provide detailed API documentation using tools like **Swagger** or **Postman**, making it easy for developers to integrate your API into their own apps.

---

## Scale and Optimize:

1. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Once you have a functional system, optimize document processing performance, ensuring your OCR microservice can handle high volumes.

2. **Deploy on GCP for Scalability**:
   - Ensure your Laravel API, Python microservice, and databases are properly deployed on GCP for scalability and cost optimization.

3. **Improve User Experience**:
   - Keep refining the user experience on the mobile app by improving search functionality, adding more document categories, or providing better UI/UX for managing documents.
