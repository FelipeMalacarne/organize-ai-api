# Tools to Help You Along the Way:

- **Version Control**: Use **Git** with **GitHub** or **GitLab** to manage your codebase.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Set up automated testing and deployments using **GitHub Actions** or **GCP Cloud Build**.
- **Task Management**: Use tools like **Trello**, **Notion**, or **Jira** to manage tasks and keep track of progress.
- **Monitoring and Logs**: Implement tools like **Sentry** or **Stackdriver** for monitoring errors and logs on both the mobile and backend.
